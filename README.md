This project builds a machine-learning model to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan using a real-world dataset of 10,000+ records. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model training using scikit-learn. Multiple classification algorithms were evaluated (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
The final model prioritizes high recall for the default class, enabling lenders to more reliably identify high-risk borrowers and reduce financial losses. Visualizations, confusion matrices, and detailed evaluation reports are included.
